         * @brief Create a cairo ImageSurface from the data and return
         * the pointer. 
         *
         * Contents are copied on creation, so this operation should
         * be considered expensive. This will only work if the given
         * OpenGL format is one of `GL_RGBA`, `GL_BGRA` or `GL_RGB`,
         * otherwise an exception is thrown.
         *
         * For `GL_RGBA`, it is neccessary to reverse the bytes order,
         * making it an even more expensive operation than it already
         * is.
         *
         * For `GL_RGB`, the data needs to be expanded to 32bit words
         * instead of 24bit words, so this is also expensive.
         *
         * The cheapest source format is `GL_ABGR`.
